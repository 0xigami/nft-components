# About dendering components

These components render information from Zora NFTs and markets with default components and settings.

Those settings can be overridden using a context component for general theme overrides and text overrides.

However, to re-structure the components themselves or to add custom components, you can pass in children to the 
rendering components to override the component structure. When no children are passed to either `NFTFullPage` or `NFTPreview`
a default out-of-the-box layout is added. To customize the layout or rendering of these components,
pass in React children to override and reset the defaults.


### With defaults:
```tsx
<NFTFullPage id="YOUR_ID" />
```

### With custom styles:
```ts
const STRINGS_OVERRIDE = {
    BIDS: "arr bids",
};
const STYLE_OVERRIDE = {
    theme: {
        bodyFont: `
            font-family: courier;
        `,
    },
};
return (
    <MediaConfiguration
        themePreset="dark"
        strings={STRINGS_OVERRIDE}
        style={STYLE_OVERRIDE}
    >
        <NFTFullPage id="YOUR_ID" />
    </MediaConfiguration>
)
```

### With custom layout:
```tsx
import {NFTFullPage, FullComponents} from '@zoralabs/nft-components';

return (
    <NFTFullPage id="YOUR_ID">
        <FullComponents.MediaInfo />
        <FullComponents.BidInfo />
    </NFTFullPage>
);
```

which, is implemented as:

```ts

```
